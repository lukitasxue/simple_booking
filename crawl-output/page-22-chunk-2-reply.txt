    "content": "Work-related travel expensesThe logbook method requires taxpayers to maintain a detailed record, known as a logbook, of their car’s business use over a continuous 12-week period. The logbook should include the following information: Start and end dates of the logbook period. Odometer readings at the start and end of the logbook period. Total kilometres traveled during the logbook period. Business-related trips, including the date, distance traveled, purpose of the trip, and odometer readings at the start and end of each trip. Once the logbook is completed, it can be used to determine the business use percentage of the car for the entire year. This percentage is then applied to the total car expenses, including fuel, repairs, maintenance, insurance, registration, and depreciation. The resulting amount represents the deductible portion of the car expenses.",

This includes uniforms, protective clothing, and costumes required for your work. Examples could be a nurse’s scrubs, a police officer’s uniform, or a chef’s kitchen attire. Compulsory uniforms: If your employer requires you to wear a specific uniform that is distinctive to your employer, you can claim the expenses for purchasing, cleaning, repairing, or replacing the uniform. The uniform should have the employer’s logo or be unique to your workplace. Protective clothing: Expenses for purchasing, cleaning, repairing, or replacing protective clothing used to protect you from the risk of illness, injury, or harm in your work are generally tax deductible. Examples include safety boots, hi-vis clothing, and safety goggles.",
