Your vehicle is not considered a car if it is a motorcycle or a vehicle with a carrying capacity of: ‚ùå one tonne or more, such as a utility truck or panel van ‚ùå nine passengers or more, such as a minivan. Keep receipts for your actual expenses. You cannot use the cents per kilometre method for these vehicles. While it is not a requirement to keep a logbook, it is the easiest way to show how you have calculated your work-related use of the vehicle. KEEPING A LOGBOOK Your logbook must cover at least 12 continuous weeks. If you started using your car for work-related purposes less than 12 weeks before the end of the year, you can extend the 12-week period into the next financial year. If you are using the logbook method for two or more cars, keep a logbook for each car and make sure they cover the same period. Your 12 week logbook is valid for 5 years. However, if your circumstances change (eg, you change jobs) and the logbook is no longer representative, you will need to complete a new 12 week logbook. Your logbook can be electronic or paper. The example below has the details you need to keep. CALCULATE YOUR WORK-RELATED CAR USE Complete this section after 12 continuous weeks of logbook use Logbook period (dd/mm/yy to dd/mm/yy) 1Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the total number of kilometres travelled during the logbook period: x,xxx km 2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the number of kilometres you travelled in the course of earning your income during the logbook period: x,xxx km 3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the work-related use by dividing the amount at (b) by the amount at (a). Multiply this figure by 100. YOUR BUSINESS USE PERCENTAGE IS: XX% Once you‚Äôve calculated your business use percentage, multiply it by your car expenses to figure out your claim. Car expenses can include running costs such as fuel, oil, and servicing, registration, insurance and vehicle depreciation. You can claim fuel and oil costs based on receipts or you can estimate the expenses based on odometer records that show readings from the start and end of the period you used the car during the year. You need written evidence for all other expenses for the car.",

You can claim your super if you: were in Australia on an eligible temporary resident visa (but not if you were on visa subclasses 405 and 410) had super contributions paid by an employer while you were in Australia.have left Australia and your working visa has either expired or been cancelled. When you meet the above conditions, you can then receive your super entitlements as a departing Australia superannuation payment (DASP). A DASP is not taxed as a superannuation lump sum benefit but is subject to tax under a final withholding tax arrangement. Your super fund will deduct this tax. Additionally, a DASP is neither your assessable income nor exempt income. DEPARTING AUSTRALIA SUPERANNUATION PAYMENT (DASP) If you have worked and earned super while visiting Australia on a temporary visa, you can apply to have this super paid to you as a departing Australia superannuation payment (DASP) after you leave. Before submitting your DASP application, check with your employer that they have paid all the super they are required to. If it has been six months or more since you left Australia, your visa has ceased to be in effect and you have not claimed DASP, your super fund will transfer your super money to the ATO as unclaimed super money. You may be required to provide certified documents for your DASP claim. It‚Äôs much easier to have documents certified in Australia so we recommend you do this before you leave. Check with your super fund to confirm what documentation is required. AUTHORISING SOMEONE TO CLAIM ON YOUR BEHALF You can authorise someone else to claim DASP for you. The person you authorise will be able to act on your behalf and update your information, so consider carefully who you allow to represent you. Your representative will need a written authority from you before they can submit your DASP claim. You can nominate: a tax agent with full registration or conditional tax agent registration with the Tax Practitioner Board for the purpose of claiming DASP.a representative if you use a DASP paper form. Anyone claiming on your behalf using a paper claim form will have to satisfy the holder of your super that they have the authority to make the claim for you. You should check with the holder to find out what documentation they require. ELIGIBILITY FOR DASP Generally, you can claim a DASP if the following apply: You accumulated superannuation while working in Australia on a temporary resident visa issued under the Migration Act 1958 (excluding Subclasses 405 and 410)Your visa has ceased to be in effect (for example, it has expired or been cancelled)You have left AustraliaYou are not an Australian or New Zealand citizen, or a permanent resident of Australia.",

ELIGIBILITY TO CLAIM Your current employment and the course you undertake must have sufficient connection for your self-education expenses to qualify as a work-related tax deduction.
