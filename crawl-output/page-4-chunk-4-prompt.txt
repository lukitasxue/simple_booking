IMPORTANT:
- You MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.
- Do NOT repeat or duplicate the same information in multiple sections. Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.
- If content fits multiple categories, include it in the most relevant one, but do NOT copy it to others.
- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details will degrade its performance.
- Be as granular as needed to ensure every piece of information is included in some section.
- If a section touches multiple themes, choose the dominant one but do NOT drop any details.
- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).
- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.
- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.

[
  {
    "category": "faq",
    "content": "How long does it take... You need to keep receipts for 5 years...",
    "confidence": 0.95

Claim Education Expenses by yaritzadigital | Sep 25, 2019 | International Students, Taxes Self-education expenses are the costs you incur to undertake a course of study at a school, college, university or other recognised place of education. If you work and study and incur self-education expenses you may be eligible for tax deductions. ELIGIBILITY TO CLAIM Your current employment and the course you undertake must have sufficient connection for your self-education expenses to qualify as a work-related tax deduction. If a course of study is too general in terms of your current income-earning activities, the necessary connection between the self-education expense and your income-earning activity does not exist. A tax deduction for your self-education expenses related to your work as an employee is available if you work and study at the same time and can satisfy any of these conditions: ✅ You are upgrading your qualifications for your current employment – for example, upgrading from a Bachelor qualification to a Masters qualification ✅ You are improving specific skills or knowledge used in your current employment – for example, a course that will allow you to operate more machinery at work ✅ You are employed as a trainee and you are undertaking a course that forms part of that traineeship – for example, an overseas trained person employed as an intern while doing a bridging course ✅ You can show that at the time you were working and studying, your course led, or was likely to lead to an increase in employment income – for example, a teacher who will automatically get a pay increase as a result of completing the course. ELIGIBLE COURSES Self-education expenses are deductible when the course you undertake leads to a formal qualification and meets the following conditions. The course must have a sufficient connection to your current work activities as an employee and: ✅ Maintain or improve the specific skills or knowledge you require in your current work activities ✅ Result in, or is likely to result in, an increase in your income from your current work activities. You can’t claim a deduction for self-education expenses for a course that doesn’t have a sufficient connection to your current work activities even though it: ❌ Might be generally related to it ❌ Enables you to get new employment – such as moving employment as a nurse to employment as a doctor. EXPENSES YOU CAN CLAIM You can claim a deduction for following expenses related to your eligible self-education: ✅ Accommodation and meals (if away from home overnight) ✅ Car expenses ✅ Computer consumables ✅ Course fees ✅ Decline in value for depreciating assets (cost exceeds $300) ✅ Purchase of equipment or technical instruments (costing $300 or less) ✅ Equipment repairs ✅ Fares ✅ Home office running costs ✅ Interest ✅ Internet usage (excluding connection fees) ✅ Parking fees (only for work-related claims) ✅ Phone calls ✅ Postage ✅ Stationery ✅ Student union fees ✅ Student services and amenities fees ✅ Textbooks ✅ Trade, professional, or academic journals ✅ Travel to-and-from place of education (only for work-related claims). Some travel for journeys can’t be claimed, but you may be able to offset the cost of these journeys against the $250 reduction. If an expense is partly for your self-education and partly for other purposes, you can only claim the amount that relates to your self-education as a deduction. EXPENSES YOU CAN’T CLAIM You can’t claim the following expenses in relation to your self-education: ❌ Tuition fees paid by someone else ❌ Repayments of Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) loans (although the fees paid by some HELP loans are) ❌ Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS) repayments ❌ Student Start-up Loan (SSL) repayments) ❌ Trade Support Loan Program (TSL) repayments ❌ Home office occupancy expenses ❌ Accommodations and meals RECORDING SELF-EDUCATION EXPENSES You may need to keep receipts or other documents showing your self-education expenses such as: 🔘 Course fees 🔘 Textbooks 🔘 Stationery 🔘 Decline in value of and repairs to depreciating assets.
