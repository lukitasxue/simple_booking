GET AN ABN If you’re starting a new business you may need an Australian business number (ABN). An ABN is a unique 11-digit identifier that makes it easier for businesses and all levels of government to interact. Not everyone is entitled to an ABN, so the registration process will ask specific questions to determine your entitlement to an ABN. Not everyone is entitled to an ABN. You’re entitled to an ABN if you’re: ✔️ Carrying on or starting an enterprise in Australia ✔️ Making supplies connected with Australia’s indirect tax zone ✔️A Corporations Act company. To work as a business you’ll need an ABN, which generally means you: 🔘 Provide products and services directly to your customers, whether that’s the public or other businesses 🔘 Source your own customers, for example by advertising your products and services 🔘 Quote and invoice for work, including setting or negotiating prices 🔘 Have a separate business bank account and your own business insurance such as public liability and WorkCover 🔘 Lodge and report all business income, even if the business earnings are below the tax free threshold. You will need an ABN to: ✔️ Operate in the GST system, including claiming GST credits ✔️ Avoid pay as you go (PAYG) tax on payments you receive ✔️ Confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing ✔️ Connect to Manage ABN Connections or get an AUSkey to transact online with government agencies ✔️ Be endorsed as a gift deductible recipient or an income tax exempt charity.",

    "content": "REGISTER YOUR BUSINESS NAME If you’re applying for an Australian business number (ABN), you can also apply for a business name and register for secure online authentication and taxes, like GST and PAYG withholding, at the same time. Most businesses will need to apply for a registered business name with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC). You can carry on a business in your own name without registering a business name if you don’t change or add anything to your name. For example, John Smith doesn’t have to register a name to trade as J Smith or John Smith, but he does to trade as John Smith Landscaping. To apply for a registered business name you will need to have applied for or have an ABN. All businesses will need to register all trading names as a business name with ASIC in order to continue operating with it. ABN Lookup will only display business names registered with ASIC from this date.",
