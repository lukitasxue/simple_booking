The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical sections. For each section, return:

- "category": one of the following, written EXACTLY as shown (case, spaces, and punctuation must match):
  - "services offered"\n  - "pricing or quotes"\n  - "contact"\n  - "booking or scheduling"\n  - "about / trust-building"\n  - "faq"\n  - "terms & conditions / legal policies"

Do NOT invent new categories. If content does not fit any, use the closest match from the list above.
- "content": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details)
- "confidence": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category

IMPORTANT:
- You MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.
- Do NOT repeat or duplicate the same information in multiple sections. Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.
- If content fits multiple categories, include it in the most relevant one, but do NOT copy it to others.
- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details will degrade its performance.
- Be as granular as needed to ensure every piece of information is included in some section.
- If a section touches multiple themes, choose the dominant one but do NOT drop any details.
- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).
- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.
- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.

Return a valid JSON array like this:

[
  {
    "category": "faq",
    "content": "How long does it take... You need to keep receipts for 5 years...",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
]
