Save and Continue Later DeductionsTax deductible expenses in Australia refer to the eligible expenditures that individuals and businesses can subtract from their taxable income, resulting in a reduction of the amount of tax they owe. These expenses are incurred in the process of generating income or carrying out business activities. By deducting these expenses, taxpayers can lower their overall taxable income, which in turn reduces the amount of tax payable. In Australia, tax deductible expenses are governed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and are subject to specific rules and limitations. To qualify as a tax deduction, an expense must meet certain criteria: Incurred for the purpose of earning income: The expense must be directly related to the generation of income or conducting business activities. Personal expenses, such as private groceries or personal entertainment, are generally not tax deductible. Supported by appropriate records: Taxpayers must maintain accurate records, such as receipts, invoices, and bank statements, to substantiate their claims for tax deductions. These records should clearly show the nature of the expense, the amount paid, and the date of the transaction.

To claim these expenses as tax deductions, individuals need to use one of two methods: the logbook method or the cents per kilometre method.Did you use your vehicle for work during the financial year?(Required)YesNoAs a general rule, travel from your home to your workplace is not allowed as a deduction because it constitutes a “private expense”. Directly between two separate workplaces; for example, when you have a second job. From your normal workplace to an alternative workplace: for example, a client’s premises while still on duty and back to your normal workplace or directly home. If your home was a base of employment – that is, if you started your work at home and traveled to a workplace to continue your work for the same employer. If you need to carry bulky tools or equipment that you used for work and can’t leave it at your workplace – like an extension ladder if you’re a trades person. Make and model of vehicle(Required)REGO of your vehicle(Required)What method do you want to use to calculate the deduction?(Required) Cents per Kilometre method Logbook Method Cents per Kilometre MethodThe cents per kilometre method is a simpler option that allows taxpayers to claim a fixed rate per business kilometre traveled, up to 5000 kilometres per vehicle per year. The rates are as follows: 78 cents per kilometre for 2022–23 72 cents per kilometre for 2020–21 and 2021–22 68 cents per kilometre for 2018–19 and 2019–2020. Total kilometres travelled for work during the financial year(Required)Please enter a number from 0 to 5000.Logbook MethodThe logbook method requires taxpayers to maintain a detailed record, known as a logbook, of their car’s business use over a continuous 12-week period. The logbook should include the following information: Start and end dates of the logbook period. Odometer readings at the start and end of the logbook period. Total kilometres traveled during the logbook period. Business-related trips, including the date, distance traveled, purpose of the trip, and odometer readings at the start and end of each trip. Once the logbook is completed, it can be used to determine the business use percentage of the car for the entire year. This percentage is then applied to the total car expenses, including fuel, repairs, maintenance, insurance, registration, and depreciation. The resulting amount represents the deductible portion of the car expenses.Do you have a logbook?(Required) Yes No If you don’t have a logbook, you can’t claim a deduction using the logbook method When did you buy your vehicle?(Required) Day Month Year How Much did you pay for your vehicle?(Required)Please enter a number greater than or equal to 0.What's the % of usage of your vehicle for work according to your logbook?(Required)Please enter a number from 0 to 100.Total of REGO paid during the financial Year(Required)Please enter a number greater than or equal to 0.Total of car insurance paid during the financial Year(Required)Please enter a number from 0 to 100.Total of Maintenance and repairs paid during the financial Year(Required)Please enter a number greater than or equal to 0.Total of petrol paid during the financial Year(Required)Please enter a number greater than or equal to 0.Work-related travel expensesThe logbook method requires taxpayers to maintain a detailed record, known as a logbook, of their car’s business use over a continuous 12-week period.

Compulsory uniforms: If your employer requires you to wear a specific uniform that is distinctive to your employer, you can claim the expenses for purchasing, cleaning, repairing, or replacing the uniform. The uniform should have the employer’s logo or be unique to your workplace. Protective clothing: Expenses for purchasing, cleaning, repairing, or replacing protective clothing used to protect you from the risk of illness, injury, or harm in your work are generally tax deductible.
