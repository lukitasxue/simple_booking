Guests   do   not   want   to   hear   the   latest   gossip   or   what’s   going   on   in   your  personal life.   Hide   your   frustration   Sometimes things can be hectic.   When there are problems behind  the scenes, keep them quiet and don’t let your customers see your  frustration.

Closing   time   Don’t   rush   the   guest   but   rather   continue   with   your   respon sibilities.   The   guest   can   usually   tell   when   it   is   time   to   finish   up   and   pay  their bill.
