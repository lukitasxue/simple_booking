4   Customer   Service   Handbook       Introduction     The person on the receiving end of your  company’s   product   and   service   is   often   referred  to as “customer,” “guest,” “client,” “tourist,”  and   “visitor.” One thing  is certain; these people  are looking for a quality experience from the  beginning. In fact, they are expecting it! If   their expectations are not met, they become  disappointed and often take their business  elsewhere. So we can clearly see that quality  does h ave value.       Quality is a process.   There are performance standards that must be  in place.   These must be communicated and implemented at all levels  in the establishment.   They require leadership from the manager or  owner.   These customer service standards nee d to be monitored,  reviewed, and updated regularly.   Customer   expectation   must   be   recognized   and   acted   upon.   Ask yourself if your definition of quality is the same as what the  customer expects. Our customers are educated, perceptive and  demanding.   When they   make a reservation, order a meal, book a  guided trip, or check into a room, they have certain expectations.  You must identify whether you are falling short, meeting or  exceeding their expectation of quality.     Your   success   is   built   on   how  well   you   deliver!

It addresses the view from  management,   staff   and   the   customer   and   their   role   in   the   chai n   of  the Quality Service Experience.
