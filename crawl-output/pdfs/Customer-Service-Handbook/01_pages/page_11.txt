This   could   be   especially   important   in   the   case   of   relatives   trying   to   contact   guests   of   a   hotel,  or someone who wants to purchase your services immediately.   Learn   how   to   prioritize   your   daily   messages   and   enquiries.   Answer  the most important one s first.   If a caller is on hold, be aware of the length of time and set a  standard   for   this.   It   is   acceptable   to   take   that   person’s   number   and  call him back if you are multi - tasking at that time.   When   leaving   town   or   being   away   from   your   business,   change   y our  voicemail to provide that information so that your potential clients  are informed.   ©   Christian   Kimber
