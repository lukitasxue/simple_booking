14   Customer   Service   Handbook   Customer   Service   Standards   ► Restaurant/Dining   Room Below are common problems and solutions to situations that occur  in the foo d and beverage environment.   Speed   of   service   Don’t   be   afraid   to   inform   customers   at   your   table   if   things   are   taking  longer than expected.   They will appreciate being kept informed on  the status of their order.   Professional   appearance   Make sure your uniform /clothing/shirt   is  clean and you are properly  groomed. Your appearance contributes to the first impression the  customers makes about your establishment. Chewing gum or eating  in front of guests is not professional.   Quality   checks   Pay   attention   to   the   body   language   a nd   facial   expressions   of   your  guests.   You can tell if something is wrong right away.   Visit the  table after you have delivered the meals as this will give you an  opportunity to correct any problems before it is too late.   Mistakes   If  y ou  ge t  t he  orde r mixe d  up, or something is incorrect  w ith  t he  meal,  don’t   be   afraid  to   recognize the error and inform the guest that  you  will  fix it immediately.   Forgive yourself! Customer   focus   Rather than gathering at the staff table or staff area in the dining  room, focus on making trips t o your customers’ tables to be visible  and available to serve your customers as needed.
