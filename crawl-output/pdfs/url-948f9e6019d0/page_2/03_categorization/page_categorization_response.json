However, we will always do our best to accommodate walk-ins if we have availability. We highly recommend booking in advance to secure your preferred time. What brands of polish do you use? We use only high-quality, professional-grade polishes known for their durability and vibrant colours, including leading brands like OPI, CND Shellac, and Essie. Is there parking available near the salon? Yes, there is typically paid street parking available on Dryburgh Street and surrounding side streets. Please allow a few extra minutes to find a spot, especially during peak times. How long will my gel manicure last? With proper care, a gel manicure can last for two to three weeks without chipping or peeling. We recommend applying cuticle oil daily and being gentle with your nails to maximize their lifespan.",
