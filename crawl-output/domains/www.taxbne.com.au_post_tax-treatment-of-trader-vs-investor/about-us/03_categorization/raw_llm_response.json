To accurately determine if you are a trader, you must consider your intention in undertaking the activity and the objective facts of the activity. Even if you have determined that you are a trader, the ATO may not agree with your interpretation.\\nIn our experience, the ATO takes into account a set of over 20 indicators to determine whether a person is a trader or an investor for tax purposes.\\nThe three main indicators to determine if you are a crypto trader are:\\n1. Repetition, volume, and regularity\\nThis indicator considers the frequency of transactions, the volume of purchases and sales, the regularity of transactions, and the scale of trading activity. Factors indicating trading activity include:\\n- Placing trades regularly and consistently.\\n- Managing trading positions regularly.\\n- Investing significant capital or obtaining a business loan for cryptocurrency trading activity.\\n- Trading with comparatively large amounts.\\n- Dedicating the equivalent of a workweek to activities related to crypto trading.\\nAt the more extreme end of a trader, someone would be operating an automated trading bot and taking advantage of small price movements in the market by placing thousands of trades per day.\\nUnlike a trader, an investor is someone who manages their portfolio a few times a year and conducts a small number of trades.\\n2. Sophistication of cryptocurrency operations\\nThis indicator determines whether trading activity is conducted as a genuine business operation. Factors indicating more sophisticated trading activity include when the trader has:\\n- Relevant qualifications and knowledge of the industry.\\n- An ABN (Australian Business Number).\\nDo I have to have an ABN to be a crypto trader?\\nNo, it is not necessary to have an ABN to be a cryptocurrency trader. However, having an ABN is a factor considered when determining if you are a trader for tax purposes.\\n- Registered a business name.\\n- A physical business location.\\n- Charting software and equipment.\\n- A complete trading system used full-time for trading.\\n- Training and development of financial and data skills.\\n- A business plan that is periodically reviewed.\\nUnlike a trader, an investor is usually employed full-time in an unrelated field and conducts trades with little research.\\n3. Trader documentation\\nTrader documentation typically includes:\\n- Business plan.\\n- Trading strategy.\\n- Trading journal.\\n- Financial statements.\\n- Detailed records.\\n- Tax invoices for expenses.\\nThese documents are used to justify the business activities being conducted.\\nAlthough a crypto investor may have an investment strategy, they do not have a business plan to generate profits. An investor buys crypto for long-term growth and/or income returns.\\nCrypto traders have a documented trading strategy, as well as a documented business plan. They prepare annual financial statements and periodic reports to assess their performance.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"Content provides detailed information and insights on tax treatment for traders and investors, fitting the category of general information or articles.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 2,\n    \"content\": \"Contact:\\n1300 189 682\\nbrisbane@ysaccounting.com.au\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.9,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"Content provides contact information, including phone number and email address.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 0,\n    \"content\": \"Accounting services\\nPersonal tax returns Business advise Xero health check Business registration Bookkeeping Start-up advise\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"Content lists the services offered by the business, which fits the category of services offered.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 4,\n    \"content\": \"Y&S Accounting proudly specialises in providing professional consulting and accounting services to the Latin American community in Australia since 2008.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.9,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"Content describes the company's specialization and history, fitting the about/trust-building category.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 6,\n    \"content\": \"Privacy Policy Terms of Service Cookies Settings\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"Content mentions legal policies and terms, fitting the terms & conditions / legal policies category.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
