Speed of service Don’t be afraid to inform customers at your table if things are taking longer than expected. They will appreciate being kept informed on the status of their order. Professional appearance Make sure your uniform /clothing/shirt is clean and you are properly groomed. Your appearance contributes to the first impression the customers makes about your establishment. Chewing gum or eating in front of guests is not professional. Quality checks Pay attention to the body language and facial expressions of your guests. You can tell if something is wrong right away. Visit the table after you have delivered the meals as this will give you an opportunity to correct any problems before it is too late. Mistakes If you get the order mixed up, or something is incorrect with the meal, don’t be afraid to recognize the error and inform the guest that you will fix it immediately. Forgive yourself!
