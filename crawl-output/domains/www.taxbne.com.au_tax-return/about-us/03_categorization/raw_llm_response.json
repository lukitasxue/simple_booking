We expect that most refunds will be out within 10 working days after lodgement of your tax return, but some people will wait a bit longer for the ATO to get it done.\\nI work with ABN and Tax File Number, Does it affect my Tax Return declaration?\\nABNs are Australian Business Numbers. They are issued to businesses operating in Australia and to self-employed people. ABNs are required on invoices for work performed. For example, if you are a carpenter, fundraiser, or personal trainer, you will need an ABN.A TFN is a Tax File Number which is required by anybody who wants to work in Australia. This number is given to all employers when you start working and your employer will then deduct tax from your income under the PAYG ( Pay As You Go ) system. People usually don't have to worry about having to pay taxes at the end of the year because their employers take taxes out of their paycheck. In the case of an ABN, tax is not taken at source, the person raising the invoice and receiving the payment is receiving full payment for products or services so a portion of that income should be retained to meet the tax liability at the end of the financial year.People understand what their obligations are when they work on either the TFN or ABN model. The confusion usually only happens when people have two jobs in one year and one is TFN and the other is ABN, or if they have a full-time job that is TFN but also have a small business that generates ABN income\\nDo I have to declare overseas income?\\nIf you are an Australian resident for tax purposes and hold a temporary visa in Australia, you are only required to declare your Australian-source income in your tax return.\\nIf you are an Australian resident for tax purposes and are a permanent resident or Australian Citizen, you are required to declare your worldwide income in your tax return.\\nI have to buy tools and equipment for my job. what can I claim on my tax?\\nThere is often confusion about what expenses can be claimed for both business and personal use. For example, if you purchase a lawnmower for your landscaping business, but you also use it to mow your own lawn, you should divide the cost of the lawnmower between the two uses based on how often you use it for each.\\nFor any tool under $300, you can claim the full cost on this year’s tax return. For any tool over $300, you need to claim the cost of the tool progressively over the course of its lifespan. This type of claim is known as depreciation, and it is in place to ensure that the amount you claim is relative to the actual value of the tool.\\nThe accelerated depreciation rules apply to sole traders and businesses where the annual income is below $5 Billion. In these cases any equipment costing less than $150,000 can be written off in total in the year it was purchased. This is a great incentive for businesses to refresh their equipment before 30 June each year.\\nYou can claim the cost of any tools or equipment that you purchase for work. This could include power tools, computers, printers, safety gear, sunglasses, office equipment and any other piece of equipment that is helpful for your income-earning activities.\\nHow long do I need to keep my receipts for?\\nRecords are written evidence of your income or expenses that can be in paper or electronic form. You will receive documents that are important for doing your tax during the income year.You need to keep records for 5 years (in most cases) from the date you lodge your tax return. Records may include income statements, payment summaries and receipts.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"The content is structured as a FAQ section, providing answers to common questions about tax returns.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 2,\n    \"content\": \"Still have questions?\\nContact us now!\\nY&S Accounting proudly specialises in providing professional consulting and accounting services to the Latin American community in Australia since 2008.\\nAddress:\\nLevel 38, 71 Eagle St, Brisbane QLD 4000\\nContact:\\n1300 189 682\\nbrisbane@ysaccounting.com.au\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"The content provides contact information and encourages reaching out for further questions, fitting the contact category.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 0,\n    \"content\": \"Accounting services\\nPersonal tax returns Business advise Xero health check Business registration Bookkeeping Start-up advise\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.9,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"The content lists the services offered by the business, which fits the services offered category.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 6,\n    \"content\": \"© 2023 Y&S Accounting Brisbane.
