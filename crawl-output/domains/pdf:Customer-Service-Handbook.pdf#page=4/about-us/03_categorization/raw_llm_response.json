In fact, they are expecting it! If their expectations are not met, they become disappointed and often take their business elsewhere. So we can clearly see that quality does have value. Quality is a process. There are performance standards that must be in place. These must be communicated and implemented at all levels in the establishment. They require leadership from the manager or owner. These customer service standards need to be monitored, reviewed, and updated regularly. Customer expectation must be recognized and acted upon. Ask yourself if your definition of quality is the same as what the customer expects. Our customers are educated, perceptive and demanding. When they make a reservation, order a meal, book a guided trip, or check into a room, they have certain expectations. You must identify whether you are falling short, meeting or exceeding their expectation of quality. Your success is built on how well you deliver! This customer service handbook attempts to provide tips, popular dos and don’ts, helpful hints, and checklists as well as proven best practices in a customer setting. It addresses the view from management, staff and the customer and their role in the chain of the Quality Service Experience.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.9,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"The content provides a general introduction and overview of customer service principles, fitting well into a general information or article category.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
