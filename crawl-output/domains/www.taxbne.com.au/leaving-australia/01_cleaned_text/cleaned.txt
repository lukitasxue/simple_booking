## Frequently asked questions
Early Tax return
¿How long does the Tax Return process takes?
Electronic tax returns are usually processed by the ATO within two weeks. We expect that most refunds will be out within 10 working days after lodgement of your tax return, but some people will wait a bit longer for the ATO to get it done.
Who is eligible for an early tax return?
To be eligible for an early tax return, you must meet the following criteria:
1. Leaving Australia permanently: You need to be departing Australia with no intention of returning before the end of the financial year for which you are filing the tax return. It applies to individuals who are leaving the country permanently.
2. ATO's acceptance deadline: The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) typically accepts early tax returns until the 15th of June. To be eligible, you must file your tax return within this timeframe.
