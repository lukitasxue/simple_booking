  "importantNotes": [
    "You MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.",
    "Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.",
    "Group closely related items: A heading and its direct content, or all points in a list that explain a single sub-topic, should generally be part of the SAME section unless the content under a heading is exceptionally long and diverse itself.",
    "If a section of content under a single heading is naturally very long but still pertains to one overarching idea, keep it as one section. Do not artificially split it unless it clearly transitions to a new, distinct topic.",
    "The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details or unnaturally split ideas will degrade its performance.",
    "Be as granular as needed for distinct topics, but prioritize grouping for coherent ideas.",
    "Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).",
    "Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.",
    "Do Not add any information that is not in the text.",
    "You MUST return a valid JSON array, even if empty. The category MUST be a number between 0 and 8."
