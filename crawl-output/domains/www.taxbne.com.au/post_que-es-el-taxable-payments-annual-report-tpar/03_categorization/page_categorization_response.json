Ensure you have the following information from them:\n- Name\n- Address\n- ABN (Australian Business Number)\n- Total amount paid during the year\n## How to lodge the form with the ATO:\nDepending on the type of business you have, there are different options to submit the TPAR form to the ATO. You can do it:\n- Using your business software to create and submit the form\n- Uploading the form through your MyGov account linked to the ATO if you are an individual or soletrader\n- Through the \" ATO's Business Portal \"\n- Through your registered tax agent\nIt's important to note that all businesses, contractors, or subcontractors in the mentioned industries must report the TPAR to the ATO, regardless of whether they made payments to other contractors or not.
