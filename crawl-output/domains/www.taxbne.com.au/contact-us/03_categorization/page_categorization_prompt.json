  "llmPrompt": "The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical, self-contained sections of information. Strive to keep closely related content (such as a heading and its immediate subsequent text, or all steps in a numbered/bulleted list) together as a single section, provided the section remains a coherent, singular topic. For EACH distinct section you identify, provide a JSON object with these exact fields:\n\n- \"category\": a number from 0-8 representing one of the following categories:\n  0: services offered\n  1: pricing or quotes\n  2: contact\n  3: booking or scheduling\n  4: about / trust-building\n  5: faq\n  6: terms & conditions / legal policies\n  7: General Information / Articles: For informative content like blog posts, articles, guides, industry insights, or company news that doesn't fall into other specific business function categories.\n  8: Uncategorized\n\n- \"content\": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details). If a heading is part of the section, include it at the beginning of this content.\n- \"confidence\": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category\n- \"confidenceReason\": a short explanation for the confidence score, describing why the content fits (or doesn't fit) the category\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.\n- Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.\n- Group closely related items: A heading and its direct content, or all points in a list that explain a single sub-topic, should generally be part of the SAME section unless the content under a heading is exceptionally long and diverse itself.\n- If a section of content under a single heading is naturally very long but still pertains to one overarching idea, keep it as one section. Do not artificially split it unless it clearly transitions to a new, distinct topic.\n- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details or unnaturally split ideas will degrade its performance.\n- Be as granular as needed for distinct topics, but prioritize grouping for coherent ideas.\n- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).\n- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.\n- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.\n- You MUST return a valid JSON array, even if empty. The category MUST be a number between 0 and 8.\n\nHere is the content to analyze:\n[NAV_START]\nAbout Us\nOur Services\nResources\nBook appointment\nContact Us\nDashboard Signup Login\n[NAV_END]\nEN\n# Contact Us\n## Brisbane office\nLevel 38 71 Eagle St Brisbane QLD 4000\n1300 189 682\n+61 439 095 870\nbrisbane@ysaccounting.com.au\nBook appointment\nTax Return Services\n## How can we help you?\n[FORM_START]\n[FORM_END]\nThank you!
