There are two methods for calculating the deduction of these expenses. The only restriction in choosing the method for calculating the deduction is the limitation of 5000 km per year per vehicle (see below for a more detailed explanation). The methods are as follows:\n## Cents per Kilometre\nThe deduction applicable with this method is as follows:\n* 85 cents per kilometre for 2023–24\n* 78 cents per kilometre for 2022–23\n* 72 cents per kilometre for 2020–21 and 2021–22\n* 68 cents per kilometre for 2018–19 and 2019–20\n* 66 cents per kilometre for 2017–18.\nWith an annual limit of 5,000 km per vehicle.
