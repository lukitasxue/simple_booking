Example: Maria Perez works in a medical laboratory with the central office in Brisbane and the production plant in Logan. Once a month, Maria has to travel from the central office to the laboratory, covering a total distance of 50 kilometers. In this case, the deduction would be $510 (50 kilometers x 12 months x 85 cents). ## Logbook The procedure for calculating the deduction for vehicle use for work through this method is as follows: * Maintain a logbook (a diary) recording ALL trips made with the vehicle over a period of 3 months. Information to collect for each trip includes: date, purpose of the trip, odometer reading at the beginning and end of the trip, total kilometers traveled. * Keep a record of ALL vehicle expenses (e.g., gasoline, maintenance, depreciation, insurance, registration). It is necessary to keep invoices for all expenses incurred for this purpose. With the collected information, the deduction can be calculated as follows: * First, calculate the percentage of vehicle use for work by dividing the total kilometers traveled for work by the total kilometers traveled by the vehicle. * Sum all vehicle expenses",
