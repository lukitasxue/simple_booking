There are two methods for calculating the deduction of these expenses. The only restriction in choosing the method for calculating the deduction is the limitation of 5000 km per year per vehicle (see below for a more detailed explanation). The methods are as follows:\n## Cents per Kilometre\nThe deduction applicable with this method is as follows:\n* 85 cents per kilometre for 2023–24\n* 78 cents per kilometre for 2022–23\n* 72 cents per kilometre for 2020–21 and 2021–22\n* 68 cents per kilometre for 2018–19 and 2019–20\n* 66 cents per kilometre for 2017–18.\nWith an annual limit of 5,000 km per vehicle. In other words, the maximum deduction that can be obtained through this method is $4,250 for the 2024 Fiscal Year (5000 kilometers x 85 cents). To justify this deduction, a diary must be maintained, including the date, purpose of the trip, and kilometers traveled for work purposes.\nExample:\nMaria Perez works in a medical laboratory with the central office in Brisbane and the production plant in Logan. Once a month, Maria has to travel from the central office to the laboratory, covering a total distance of 50 kilometers. In this case, the deduction would be $510 (50 kilometers x 12 months x 85 cents).\n## Logbook\nThe procedure for calculating the deduction for vehicle use for work through this method is as follows:\n* Maintain a logbook (a diary) recording ALL trips made with the vehicle over a period of 3 months. Information to collect for each trip includes: date, purpose of the trip, odometer reading at the beginning and end of the trip, total kilometers traveled.\n* Keep a record of ALL vehicle expenses (e.g., gas \n    ---\n    Segment the above into distinct semantic chunks (target ~200 words each, which is roughly 266 tokens) and categorize each using: services offered, pricing or quotes, contact, booking or scheduling, about / trust-building, faq, terms & conditions / legal policies, General Information / Articles: For informative content like blog posts, articles, guides, industry insights, or company news that doesn't fall into other specific business function categories., Uncategorized.\n    Output JSON: [{chunkOrder, chunkText, category (numeric enum value for Category type), confidence (0.0-1.0), sourceUrl, pageTitle}]\n  ",

It is necessary to keep invoices for all expenses incurred for this purpose.

Example: Maria Perez correctly maintained her logbook during the quarter from February to April. The total kilometers traveled during this quarter were 8,500 kilometers. The total kilometers for work were 3,500 kilometers. Therefore, the percentage of vehicle use for work is 41% (3,500 kilometers / 8,500 kilometers * 100). At the same time, Maria incurred the following expenses and kept invoices for them: * Gasoline = $5500 * Registration = $700 * Insurance = $700 * Maintenance = $1300 In this case, the total value that Maria can deduct is $3,362 (8,200 * 41%). ## ‍ #### Still have questions?
