  "llmPrompt": "The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical, self-contained sections of information. Strive to keep closely related content (such as a heading and its immediate subsequent text, or all steps in a numbered/bulleted list) together as a single section, provided the section remains a coherent, singular topic. For EACH distinct section you identify, provide a JSON object with these exact fields:\n\n- \"category\": a number from 0-8 representing one of the following categories:\n  0: services offered\n  1: pricing or quotes\n  2: contact\n  3: booking or scheduling\n  4: about / trust-building\n  5: faq\n  6: terms & conditions / legal policies\n  7: General Information / Articles: For informative content like blog posts, articles, guides, industry insights, or company news that doesn't fall into other specific business function categories.\n  8: Uncategorized\n\n- \"content\": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details). If a heading is part of the section, include it at the beginning of this content.\n- \"confidence\": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category\n- \"confidenceReason\": a short explanation for the confidence score, describing why the content fits (or doesn't fit) the category\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.\n- Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.\n- Group closely related items: A heading and its direct content, or all points in a list that explain a single sub-topic, should generally be part of the SAME section unless the content under a heading is exceptionally long and diverse itself.\n- If a section of content under a single heading is naturally very long but still pertains to one overarching idea, keep it as one section. Do not artificially split it unless it clearly transitions to a new, distinct topic.\n- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details or unnaturally split ideas will degrade its performance.\n- Be as granular as needed for distinct topics, but prioritize grouping for coherent ideas.\n- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).\n- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.\n- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.\n- You MUST return a valid JSON array, even if empty. The category MUST be a number between 0 and 8.\n\nHere is the content to analyze:\n[NAV_START]\nAbout Us\nOur Services\nResources\nBook appointment\nContact Us\nDashboard Signup Login\n[NAV_END]\nEN\nAll Posts\n5 min read\n# Tax treatment of trader vs investor\nWritten by\nSebastian Garcia\nPublished on\nApril 11, 2024\nFor a trader, cryptocurrencies are considered trading stock.\nFor an investor, cryptocurrencies are an asset subject to CGT upon sale.\nHow to determine if you are a \"trader\" or an investor for tax purposes\nThere is no fixed list of rules to determine who is and who is not a trader. To accurately determine if you are a trader, you must consider your intention in undertaking the activity and the objective facts of the activity. Even if you have determined that you are a trader, the ATO may not agree with your interpretation.\nIn our experience, the ATO takes into account a set of over 20 indicators to determine whether a person is a trader or an investor for tax purposes.\nThe three main indicators to determine if you are a crypto trader are:\n1. Repetition, volume, and regularity\nThis indicator considers the frequency of transactions, the volume of purchases and sales, the regularity of transactions, and the scale of trading activity. Factors indicating trading activity include:\n- Placing trades regularly and consistently.\n- Managing trading positions regularly.\n- Investing significant capital or obtaining a business loan for cryptocurrency trading activity.\n- Trading with comparatively large amounts.\n- Dedicating the equivalent of a workweek to activities related to crypto trading.\nAt the more extreme end of a trader, someone would be operating an automated trading bot and taking advantage of small price movements in the market by placing thousands of trades per day.\nUnlike a trader, an investor is someone who manages their portfolio a few times a year and conducts a small number of trades.\n2. Sophistication of cryptocurrency operations\nThis indicator determines whether trading activity is conducted as a genuine business operation. Factors indicating more sophisticated trading activity include when the trader has:\n- Relevant qualifications and knowledge of the industry.\n- An ABN (Australian Business Number).\nDo I have to have an ABN to be a crypto trader?\nNo, it is not necessary to have an ABN to be a cryptocurrency trader. However, having an ABN is a factor considered when determining if you are a trader for tax purposes.\n- Registered a business name.\n- A physical business location.\n- Charting software and equipment.\n- A complete trading system used full-time for trading.\n- Training and development of financial and data skills.\n- A business plan that is periodically reviewed.\nUnlike a trader, an investor is usually employed full-time in an unrelated field and conducts trades with little research.\n3. Trader documentation\nTrader documentation typically includes:\n- Business plan.\n- Trading strategy.\n- Trading journal.\n- Financial statements.\n- Detailed records.\n- Tax invoices for expenses.\nThese documents are used to justify the business activities being conducted.\nAlthough a crypto investor may have an investment strategy, they do not have a business plan to generate profits. An investor buys crypto for long-term growth and/or income returns.\nCrypto traders have a documented trading strategy, as well as a documented business plan. They prepare annual financial statements and periodic reports to assess their performance.\n‍\n#### Still have questions?\nContact us now!\nSubscribe to newsletter\nSubscribe to receive the latest blog posts to your inbox every week.\n[FORM_START]\nBy subscribing you agree to with our Privacy Policy.\n[FORM_END]\nThank you!
