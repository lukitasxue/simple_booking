For an investor, cryptocurrencies are an asset subject to CGT upon sale. How to determine if you are a \"trader\" or an investor for tax purposes There is no fixed list of rules to determine who is and who is not a trader. To accurately determine if you are a trader, you must consider your intention in undertaking the activity and the objective facts of the activity. Even if you have determined that you are a trader, the ATO may not agree with your interpretation. In our experience, the ATO takes into account a set of over 20 indicators to determine whether a person is a trader or an investor for tax purposes. The three main indicators to determine if you are a crypto trader are: 1.

At the more extreme end of a trader, someone would be operating an automated trading bot and taking advantage of small price movements in the market by placing thousands of trades per day. Unlike a trader, an investor is someone who manages their portfolio a few times a year and conducts a small number of trades. 2. Sophistication of cryptocurrency operations This indicator determines whether trading activity is conducted as a genuine business operation. Factors indicating more sophisticated trading activity include when the trader has: - Relevant qualifications and knowledge of the industry. - An ABN (Australian Business Number). Do I have to have an ABN to be a crypto trader? No, it is not necessary to have an ABN to be a cryptocurrency trader. However, having an ABN is a factor considered when determining if you are a trader for tax purposes. - Registered a business name. - A physical business location. -",

Unlike a trader, an investor is usually employed full-time in an unrelated field and conducts trades with little research. 3. Trader documentation Trader documentation typically includes: - Business plan. - Trading strategy. - Trading journal. - Financial statements. - Detailed records. - Tax invoices for expenses. These documents are used to justify the business activities being conducted. Although a crypto investor may have an investment strategy, they do not have a business plan to generate profits. An investor buys crypto for long-term growth and/or income returns. Crypto traders have a documented trading strategy, as well as a documented business plan. They prepare annual financial statements and periodic reports to assess their performance. ‍ #### Still have questions? Contact us now!
