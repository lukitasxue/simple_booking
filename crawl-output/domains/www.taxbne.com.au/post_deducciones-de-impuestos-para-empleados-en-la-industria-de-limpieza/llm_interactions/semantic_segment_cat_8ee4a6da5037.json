There are several key expenses you cannot claim, including: - Everyday clothing you wear to your workplace that can also be worn outside of work (like casual wear, sneakers, or a plain shirt), even if you bought it specifically to wear to work. - Any tools or equipment, such as a vacuum cleaner or cleaning products, if provided by your employer. - The cost of any meals or snacks consumed during a normal workday, even if your employer gives you an allowance to cover meal expenses. ## What records should I keep? - Receipts are crucial during tax time. It's a good idea to create an easy and reliable system to stay organized throughout the year. Remember that you don't need to keep physical receipts, and it's acceptable to keep a digital copy (like a photo of a receipt or an email receipt) as long as it's readable: - The provider's name. - The expense amounts. - The nature of the goods or services. - The date the expense was paid. - Date. - You don't need to keep receipts for expenses under $10 (if they don't exceed $200 in total). ##",
