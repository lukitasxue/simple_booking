Cryptocurrencies: Buying and selling information. 7. Public Agencies: Pensions, benefits, taxable bonuses, grants, and other payments. Example: After the filing period, the ATO compared information provided by a taxpayer with the Medicare database. Upon comparison, it was evident that the taxpayer did not apply to determine eligibility for exemption from Medicare levy. Consequently, the taxpayer was notified and must apply for the specified period, make the necessary correction, and pay if required. NOTE: Presenting a voluntary correction to the taxoffice is advisable. ## ‍ #### Still have questions? Contact us now!
