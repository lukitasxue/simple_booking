      "chunkText": "# What is the Medicare levy and how does it affect my tax return?\nWritten by\nPublished on\nJanuary 11, 2024\nThe Medicare levy helps fund part of the costs of the Australian public health system known as Medicare. This tax corresponds to 2% of your taxable income, in addition to the tax you pay on your taxable income.\nIt's possible to obtain a reduction or exemption from paying the Medicare levy, depending on your circumstances and those of your spouse. You should consider separately your right to a reduction or exemption.\nThe Medicare levy is collected in the same way as income tax. Generally, the amount your employer withholds from your salary or wages includes an amount to cover the Medicare levy. The ATO calculates the Medicare levy payable when you lodge your tax return.",
