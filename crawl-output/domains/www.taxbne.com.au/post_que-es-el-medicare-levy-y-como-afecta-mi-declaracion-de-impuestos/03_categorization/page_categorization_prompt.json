  "llmPrompt": "The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical, self-contained sections of information. Strive to keep closely related content (such as a heading and its immediate subsequent text, or all steps in a numbered/bulleted list) together as a single section, provided the section remains a coherent, singular topic. For EACH distinct section you identify, provide a JSON object with these exact fields:\n\n- \"category\": a number from 0-8 representing one of the following categories:\n  0: services offered\n  1: pricing or quotes\n  2: contact\n  3: booking or scheduling\n  4: about / trust-building\n  5: faq\n  6: terms & conditions / legal policies\n  7: General Information / Articles: For informative content like blog posts, articles, guides, industry insights, or company news that doesn't fall into other specific business function categories.\n  8: Uncategorized\n\n- \"content\": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details). If a heading is part of the section, include it at the beginning of this content.\n- \"confidence\": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category\n- \"confidenceReason\": a short explanation for the confidence score, describing why the content fits (or doesn't fit) the category\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.\n- Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.\n- Group closely related items: A heading and its direct content, or all points in a list that explain a single sub-topic, should generally be part of the SAME section unless the content under a heading is exceptionally long and diverse itself.\n- If a section of content under a single heading is naturally very long but still pertains to one overarching idea, keep it as one section. Do not artificially split it unless it clearly transitions to a new, distinct topic.\n- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details or unnaturally split ideas will degrade its performance.\n- Be as granular as needed for distinct topics, but prioritize grouping for coherent ideas.\n- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).\n- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.\n- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.\n- You MUST return a valid JSON array, even if empty. The category MUST be a number between 0 and 8.\n\nHere is the content to analyze:\n[NAV_START]\nAbout Us\nOur Services\nResources\nBook appointment\nContact Us\nDashboard Signup Login\n[NAV_END]\nEN\nAll Posts\nGeneral\n5 min read\n# What is the Medicare levy and how does it affect my tax return?\nWritten by\nPublished on\nJanuary 11, 2024\nThe Medicare levy helps fund part of the costs of the Australian public health system known as Medicare.
