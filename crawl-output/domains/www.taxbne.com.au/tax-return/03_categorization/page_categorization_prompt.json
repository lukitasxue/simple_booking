  "llmPrompt": "The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical, self-contained sections of information. Strive to keep closely related content (such as a heading and its immediate subsequent text, or all steps in a numbered/bulleted list) together as a single section, provided the section remains a coherent, singular topic. For EACH distinct section you identify, provide a JSON object with these exact fields:\n\n- \"category\": a number from 0-8 representing one of the following categories:\n  0: services offered\n  1: pricing or quotes\n  2: contact\n  3: booking or scheduling\n  4: about / trust-building\n  5: faq\n  6: terms & conditions / legal policies\n  7: General Information / Articles: For informative content like blog posts, articles, guides, industry insights, or company news that doesn't fall into other specific business function categories.\n  8: Uncategorized\n\n- \"content\": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details). If a heading is part of the section, include it at the beginning of this content.\n- \"confidence\": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category\n- \"confidenceReason\": a short explanation for the confidence score, describing why the content fits (or doesn't fit) the category\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.\n- Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.\n- Group closely related items: A heading and its direct content, or all points in a list that explain a single sub-topic, should generally be part of the SAME section unless the content under a heading is exceptionally long and diverse itself.\n- If a section of content under a single heading is naturally very long but still pertains to one overarching idea, keep it as one section. Do not artificially split it unless it clearly transitions to a new, distinct topic.\n- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details or unnaturally split ideas will degrade its performance.\n- Be as granular as needed for distinct topics, but prioritize grouping for coherent ideas.\n- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).\n- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.\n- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.\n- You MUST return a valid JSON array, even if empty. The category MUST be a number between 0 and 8.\n\nHere is the content to analyze:\nRental property +$45\n## What our customers say\nDiana Franco\nI can't recommend Sebastian enough.

Looking after their economical costumer wellness.\nJuan Pablo Vasquez\nThis is the 4th year making my tax return with no issues and exceptional professionalisms. Strongly recommend them.\n## Frequently asked questions\nIndividual Tax returns\n¿How long does the Tax Return process takes?\nElectronic tax returns are usually processed by the ATO within two weeks. We expect that most refunds will be out within 10 working days after lodgement of your tax return, but some people will wait a bit longer for the ATO to get it done.\nI work with ABN and Tax File Number, Does it affect my Tax Return declaration?\nABNs are Australian Business Numbers. They are issued to businesses operating in Australia and to self-employed people. ABNs are required on invoices for work performed. For example, if you are a carpenter, fundraiser, or personal trainer, you will need an ABN.A TFN is a Tax File Number which is required by anybody who wants to work in Australia. This number is given to all employers when you start working and your employer will then deduct tax from your income under the PAYG ( Pay As You Go ) system. People usually don't have to worry about having to pay taxes at the end of the year because their employers take taxes out of their paycheck. In the case of an ABN, tax is not taken at source, the person raising the invoice and receiving the payment is receiving full payment for products or services so a portion of that income should be retained to meet the tax liability at the end of the financial year.People understand what their obligations are when they work on either the TFN or ABN model. The confusion usually only happens when people have two jobs in one year and one is TFN and the other is ABN, or if they have a full-time job that is TFN but also have a small business that generates ABN income\nDo I have to declare overseas income?\nIf you are an Australian resident for tax purposes and hold a temporary visa in Australia, you are only required to declare your Australian-source income in your tax return.\nIf you are an Australian resident for tax purposes and are a permanent resident or Australian Citizen, you are required to declare your worldwide income in your tax return.\nI have to buy tools and equipment for my job. what can I claim on my tax?\nThere is often confusion about what expenses can be claimed for both business and personal use. For example, if you purchase a lawnmower for your landscaping business, but you also use it to mow your own lawn, you should divide the cost of the lawnmower between the two uses based on how often you use it for each.\nFor any tool under $300, you can claim the full cost on this year’s tax return. For any tool over $300, you need to claim the cost of the tool progressively over the course of its lifespan. This type of claim is known as depreciation, and it is in place to ensure that the amount you claim is relative to the actual value of the tool.\nThe accelerated depreciation rules apply to sole traders and businesses where the annual income is below $5 Billion. In these cases any equipment costing less than $150,000 can be written off in total in the year it was purchased. This is a great incentive for businesses to refresh their equipment before 30 June each year.\nYou can claim the cost of any tools or equipment that you purchase for work. This could include power tools, computers, printers, safety gear, sunglasses, office equipment and any other piece of equipment that is helpful for your income-earning activities.\nHow long do I need to keep my receipts for?\nRecords are written evidence of your income or expenses that can be in paper or electronic form. You will receive documents that are important for doing your tax during the income year.You need to keep records for 5 years (in most cases) from the date you lodge your tax return. Records may include income statements, payment summaries and receipts.\n#### Still have questions?\nContact us now!\nY&S Accounting proudly specialises in providing professional consulting and accounting services to the Latin American community in Australia since 2008.\nAccounting services\nPersonal tax returns Business advise Xero health check Business registration Bookkeeping Start-up advise\nAddress:\nLevel 38, 71 Eagle St, Brisbane QLD 4000\nContact:\n1300 189 682\nbrisbane@ysaccounting.com.au\n© 2023 Y&S Accounting Brisbane.
