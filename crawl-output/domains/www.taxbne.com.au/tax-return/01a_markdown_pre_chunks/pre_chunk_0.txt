## Individual tax returns
Tax laws can be confusing. If you don’t have the time, patience, or ability to maximise your tax return, you can take advantage of these often missed tax deductions and credits to get more money back in your pocket by seeking the advice of one of our competent tax professionals. Tax returns cover the financial year from 1 July to 30 June. As a registered tax agent, we have special lodgement schedules and can lodge returns for clients later than the 31 October deadline.
