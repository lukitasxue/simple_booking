Try to set a specific number of rings, and make it your goal to answer before the 4th ring, for example. All employees or family members should be trained to answer the phone properly. If there are children answering the business phone, they should be able to give the minimum key information. Answer all calls in a courteous manner. A scripted consistent greeting works well and sounds professional. An example would be, “Good morning, West Orchard, Susan speaking. How can I help you?’ During business hours, a person should be answering the main number instead of having voice mail or an automated message. Staff should listen, understand, and acknowledge the nature of the request before transferring any calls. Where possible, give the client the option to go to voice mail or leave a message verbally. All staff and management should adhere to a policy that sets timelines to returning calls and responding to enquiries. Same day is recommended. All outgoing voice mail (recorded greeting) messages should be brief, current and accurate. An example would be: “Hello, You have reached Cass at Eclipse Gurus. I’m out of the office until June 1st. Please leave a message and I will return your call as soon as possible” A good outgoing voice mail message will contain the person’s name, department, telephone numbers and time available.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"The content provides detailed guidelines and best practices for handling telephone and voice mail communication, fitting well into general information or articles.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
