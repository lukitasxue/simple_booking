Poor profitability: Start to monitor profit, identify issues regularly and consider areas such as: gross and net margins, sales, review the productivity of your staff. 3. Inadequate financial records: Itâ€™s critical to keep your records up-to-date and monitor them regularly. Make sure all your invoices and payments are entered weekly into your financial system. 4.
