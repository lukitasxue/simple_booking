The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical sections. For each section, return:

- "category": one of the following, written EXACTLY as shown (case, spaces, and punctuation must match):
  - "services offered"\n  - "pricing or quotes"\n  - "contact"\n  - "booking or scheduling"\n  - "about / trust-building"\n  - "faq"\n  - "terms & conditions / legal policies"

Do NOT invent new categories. If content does not fit any, use the closest match from the list above.
- "content": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details)
- "confidence": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category

IMPORTANT:
- You MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.
- Do NOT repeat or duplicate the same information in multiple sections. Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.
- If content fits multiple categories, include it in the most relevant one, but do NOT copy it to others.
- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details will degrade its performance.
- Be as granular as needed to ensure every piece of information is included in some section.
- If a section touches multiple themes, choose the dominant one but do NOT drop any details.
- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).
- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.
- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.

Return a valid JSON array like this:

[
  {
    "category": "faq",
    "content": "How long does it take... You need to keep receipts for 5 years...",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
]

Medicare Many people are confused and do not know what medicare is and why this insurance is charged in the tax return, so we are going to explain to you what medicare is, and on what occasions you can be exempt from this payment. Let’s begin, Medicare is Australia’s universal health insurance scheme. It guarantees all Australians access to a wide range of health and hospital services at low or no cost. Medicare is partly funded by taxpayers who pay a Medicare Levy of 2.0% of their taxable income, that is why the Medicare levy is collected from Australians in the same way as income tax. The actual Medicare levy is calculated by the Australia Taxation office when people lodge their income tax return. But, when can I apply for a Medicare levy exemption? It is important that people know that they can apply for a Medicare levy exemption if they were in of the 3 following exemption categories at any time in the financial year: You meet certain Medicare requirements, such as: You were a blind pensionerYou received sickness allowance from CentrelinkYou were entitled to full free medical treatment for all conditions under Defence Force arrangements or Veterans Affairs Repatriation Health card.
