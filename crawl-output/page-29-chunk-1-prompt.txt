The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical sections. For each section, return:

- "category": one of the following, written EXACTLY as shown (case, spaces, and punctuation must match):
  - "services offered"\n  - "pricing or quotes"\n  - "contact"\n  - "booking or scheduling"\n  - "about / trust-building"\n  - "faq"\n  - "terms & conditions / legal policies"

Do NOT invent new categories. If content does not fit any, use the closest match from the list above.
- "content": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details)
- "confidence": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category

IMPORTANT:
- You MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.
- Do NOT repeat or duplicate the same information in multiple sections. Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.
- If content fits multiple categories, include it in the most relevant one, but do NOT copy it to others.
- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details will degrade its performance.
- Be as granular as needed to ensure every piece of information is included in some section.
- If a section touches multiple themes, choose the dominant one but do NOT drop any details.
- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).
- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.
- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.

Return a valid JSON array like this:

[
  {
    "category": "faq",
    "content": "How long does it take... You need to keep receipts for 5 years...",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
]

Claim Education Expenses International Students, Taxes Self-education expenses are the costs you incur to undertake a course of study at a school, college, university or other recognised place of education. If you work and study and incur self-education expenses you may be eligible for tax deductions. ELIGIBILITY TO CLAIM Your current employment and the course you undertake must have sufficient connection for your self-education expenses to qualify as a work-related tax deduction. If a course of study is too general in terms of your current income-earning activities, the necessary connection between the self-education expense and your income-earning activity does not exist. A tax deduction for your self-education expenses related to your work as an employee is available if you work and study at the same time and can satisfy any of these conditions: ‚úÖ You are upgrading your qualifications for your current employment ‚Äì for example, upgrading from a Bachelor qualification to a Masters qualification ‚úÖ You are improving specific skills or knowledge used in your current employment ‚Äì for example, a course that will allow you to operate more machinery at work ‚úÖ You are employed as a trainee and you are undertaking a course that forms part of that traineeship ‚Äì for example, an overseas trained person employed as an intern while doing a bridging course ‚úÖ You can show that at the time you were working and studying, your course led, or was likely to lead to an increase in employment income ‚Äì for example, a teacher who will automatically get a pay increase as a result of completing the course. ELIGIBLE COURSES Self-education expenses are deductible when the course you undertake leads to a formal qualification and meets the following conditions. The course must have a sufficient connection to your current work activities as an employee and: ‚úÖ Maintain or improve the specific skills or knowledge you require in your current work activities ‚úÖ Result in, or is likely to result in, an increase in your income from your current work activities. You can‚Äôt claim a deduction for self-education expenses for a course that doesn‚Äôt have a sufficient connection to your current work activities even though it: ‚ùå Might be generally related to it ‚ùå Enables you to get new employment ‚Äì such as moving employment as a nurse to employment as a doctor. EXPENSES YOU CAN CLAIM You can claim a deduction for following expenses related to your eligible self-education: ‚úÖ Accommodation and meals (if away from home overnight) ‚úÖ Car expenses ‚úÖ Computer consumables ‚úÖ Course fees ‚úÖ Decline in value for depreciating assets (cost exceeds $300) ‚úÖ Purchase of equipment or technical instruments (costing $300 or less) ‚úÖ Equipment repairs ‚úÖ Fares ‚úÖ Home office running costs ‚úÖ Interest ‚úÖ Internet usage (excluding connection fees) ‚úÖ Parking fees (only for work-related claims) ‚úÖ Phone calls ‚úÖ Postage ‚úÖ Stationery ‚úÖ Student union fees ‚úÖ Student services and amenities fees ‚úÖ Textbooks ‚úÖ Trade, professional, or academic journals ‚úÖ Travel to-and-from place of education (only for work-related claims). Some travel for journeys can‚Äôt be claimed, but you may be able to offset the cost of these journeys against the $250 reduction. If an expense is partly for your self-education and partly for other purposes, you can only claim the amount that relates to your self-education as a deduction. EXPENSES YOU CAN‚ÄôT CLAIM You can‚Äôt claim the following expenses in relation to your self-education: ‚ùå Tuition fees paid by someone else ‚ùå Repayments of Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) loans (although the fees paid by some HELP loans are) ‚ùå Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS) repayments ‚ùå Student Start-up Loan (SSL) repayments) ‚ùå Trade Support Loan Program (TSL) repayments ‚ùå Home office occupancy expenses ‚ùå Accommodations and meals RECORDING SELF-EDUCATION EXPENSES You may need to keep receipts or other documents showing your self-education expenses such as: üîò Course fees üîò Textbooks üîò Stationery üîò Decline in value of and repairs to depreciating assets. You must also keep receipts, documents or diary entries for travel expenses.
